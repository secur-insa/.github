Welcome 👩‍💻

This is the GitHub organization of Secur'INSA, the infosec club of [INSA Rennes](https://www.insa-rennes.fr). We collect tools, projects, and other bits and bobs of code.

Our club helps us share knowledge about various topics such as OSINT 🔍, cryptography 🔐, reverse-engineering ↪, web security 🌐, hardware security 💾, and many more.

We are also looking into developing our own CTFs, so stay tuned for more information about that in the future 👀.
